title: National interactive map of college advising resources
custom_css: about
---



We created this interactive map to highlight differences by community
in how much access students have to school- and community-based
college advising. Numerous research studies show that [school
counselors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1556-6676.2014.00159.x)
and [high-quality college advising
programs](http://people.tamu.edu/~abarr/BL_shell_10_17_2017.pdf) can
lead to substantially greater rates of college enrollment and
persistence for low-income and first-generation students.  

Some students--because of where they live or their family's
affluence--have access to extensive college planning supports. Many
other hard working, talented students, however, do not have people
they can turn to in their schools or communities for support
completing college and financial aid applications.  

This lack of access to college advising contributes to persistent
[socioeconomic inequalities in college access and
completion](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17633).  

## How to use the map 

The map incorporates college planning resources
from numerous sources. We have tried to make the map as intuitive and
easy to use as possible. A few suggestions to get started:   
1. Use the navigation buttons, your mouse, or touch gestures on the
   map to navigate around the country and zoom; icons will appear as
   you zoom to the state and local levels.  
2. Enter an address, zip code
   or city into the search bar to fly to that location.  
3. Click on the target button to fly and zoom in on your current
   location.  
4. When zoomed into an area, fly to a particular school or
   community icon by clicking on its name in the drop down list on the
   left; filter the icons shown on the filter screen in the upper left
   of the map.  
5. Toggle college icons on and off using the button in
   the top left corner of the map.  
6. If viewing the map from a mobile device, add the map as an icon to
   your home screen so that you can view the map using the entire
   device screen.  

You might also find it helpful to read some of our [case
studies](#case-studies-and-examples-for-using-the-map) to see
   how this map can be most useful for you.  

## Help us keep the map current and accurate!  

The map is and will remain free for any individual to use.  We hope
that the college planning community--practitioners, leaders, policy
makers, funders, and researchers--will contribute to the [completeness
of the map by sharing information]({{ site.form }}) about college
advising programs that we have not currently captured in the map. We
also welcome [technical feedback]({{ site.github }}) on how to improve
the map's functionality. The map's underlying [data can also be
downloaded]({{ site.mapdata }}) for free.

*For more on why we created this map, what we hope it will achieve, and
how you can help us keep it current and accurate, please keep reading.*

## College advising at the state and federal levels
For over a decade the federal government has supported college
advising programs at the high school, community, and college level
through the TRIO and GEAR UP programs. More recently, several states
have pursued statewide college advising initiatives, like
[AdviseTN](https://www.tn.gov/thec/bureaus/student-aid-and-compliance/college-access/redirect-college-access-and-success/advise-tn.html)
in Tennessee.  

Advances in interactive technologies and innovations in college
advising have now made it possible to provide personalized information
and one-on-one college guidance to students across the country, even
if they don't have access to these resources in their own
communities. Former First Lady Michelle Obama's [Up
Next](https://www.bettermakeroom.org/up-next/) campaign provides young
Americans with text message reminders about important college and
financial aid application deadlines and resources, and makes it
possible for students to connect with college advisors via text
message. [CollegePoint](https://www.collegepoint.info/) is a Bloomberg
Philanthropies-funded national virtual college advising initiative
that provides high-achieving, low- and moderate-income high school
students across the country with sustained, one-on-one advising
throughout the college and financial aid application processes.

## Which communities and students should national and state advising initiatives target?  

As similar national and regional college advising initiatives expand,
there will be increasing value in targeting these efforts to schools
and communities that would otherwise lack access to high-quality
college and financial aid information and assistance.

While there are several existing directories that provide partial
information about the availability of college planning resources in
communities across the country, we did not find an existing database
that comprehensively tracks these resources. Nor are the existing
databases structured in a way that allows people to easily interact
and explore college advising resources in their community or state.

## Case studies and examples for using the map

The information from this map can be understood and used in many
different ways depending on your role and relationship to the college
advising system. With that in mind, we've written a number of short
case studies to illustrate how you might make the most of this
resource:  

* As the grant reviewer for a **national funder**, you've received an
application from the Westfield, Pennsylvania school district and would
like more context for the college advising program they propose. You
search for the town on the map and see that several schools in the
area have strikingly high student-counselor ratios, no apparent
community-based advising programs, and a high proportion of FRPL
students. After seeing the high need and potential impact in this
area, you decide to forward this proposal for further review.  
* As a **state policy maker** in Oregon, you've taken an interest in
college access as a state-wide issue. Looking around Oregon on the
map, you see that while a handful of schools in the central and
western regions are served by community-based advising organizations,
many are not. Noticing also that most of these schools seem to lack
counselors entirely, you realize it may be worth investigating
policies that support students without access to these critical
resources.  
* As a **college admissions officer** working in a post-secondary
institution in Miami, Florida, you would like to see if there are high
schools in the area that would benefit from support with the college
application process. You browse the city map and compare schools with
and without TRIO support, high and low counselor ratios, and varying
proximity to other higher education institutions. Picking a few
schools that have also had historically low application rates for your
institution, you set up an outreach agenda for the next month.  
* As the **parent** of a student in Greeley, Colorado, you want to see
if there are any community advising organizations in your area that
your child can access. You search for your school on the map and see
that both GEAR UP and TRIO operate in the city. After looking up
eligibility and program details, you decide to call each program to
learn more.  
* As a **student** in Atlanta, Georgia, you've heard of a few colleges
  you could apply to in the area after graduation. With a quick search
  on the map, you see that there are far more schools nearby than you
  expected, and you also see a link to the college advising
  organization at your high school. With all this in mind, you set up
  a meeting with your school counselor to think more about next steps.
